# NYC Taxi Tips & Borough Trends (WIP)
**Understanding Tipping Behavior Across Boroughs and Segments**

## Project Overview

This project explores tipping behavior in New York City ride-hailing and taxi services, including Uber, Lyft, and yellow taxis. Using [NYC TLC Trip Record Data 2025](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page), the goal is to uncover how different characteristics influence tip amounts and patterns.

The analysis is performed using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. All development is done in VSCode, with version control handled through Git.

## Objectives

### 1. Understanding the Data
- Explore ride characteristics: pickup/dropoff locations, time of day, duration, and distance.
- Segment and clean data across different services (Uber, Lyft, yellow taxis).
- Compare rides across boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, Staten Island.

### 2. Location-Based Tipping Behavior
- Identify pricier neighborhoods and their tipping tendencies.
- Compare average tip amounts across pickup/dropoff zones.
- Analyze consistency of tipping (e.g., by calculating interquartile range or using mode).
- Include analysis of major transit points like **airports** (JFK, LGA, EWR).

### 3. Time-Based Tipping Behavior
- Segment by time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Night).
- Compare tipping on **weekends vs. weekdays**.
- Evaluate tipping after working hours and during nightlife periods.

### 4. Customer & Payment Segmentation
- Analyze by:
  - **Passenger count** (e.g., group rides might influence tipping).
  - **Payment types** (credit card vs. cash).
  - **Subscription users** (UberOne, LyftPink) â€” limited to `fhvhv` dataset.
  - **Additional fees** and their impact on tipping.
  - Frequent vs. non-frequent riders (if data allows tracking).

### 5. Driver/Vendor Impact
- Compare tipping across different vendor types.
- Study the impact of **wait times** (request time vs. actual pickup) on tipping behavior.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment**: VSCode
- **Version Control**: Git
